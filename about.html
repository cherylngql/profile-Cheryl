			<p>Born in Singapore, I have grown up loving physics, mathematics, and then fallen in love with programming later on in life.
        To me, they are the manifestation of elegance of the universe; they are unambiguous yet complex, logical yet magical; they
        are rules inevitably made or explained by man and are of instructional nature, yet with them, men are capable of infinite creations.
        <br/><br/> Learning about programming has lead me to a new path of possibilites where I can start using skills picked up on my way learning about the world
        through physics and mathematics to create. I am working towards becoming a software developer to realize many tiny dreams of mine.
